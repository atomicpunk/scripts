# GPS Privacy: a tool to remove personal data from image files before
# submitting them publicly. Your phone can stamp images with a lat/lon
# giving total strangers a map to your house. Even without the GPS stamp
# some image sites will find your location via your IP address. This script
# deletes the GPS stamp for all images found and replaces it with a fake
# location. This way the image sites will always map the photos to a fake
# location in the middle of the Pacific ocean.
